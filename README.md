# TemperatureTaker
- Due to Covid-19, NUS students are required to take their temperature on an online website, and so we decided to make things easier by allowing them to run a single command on telegram to take their temperature!

1. Telegram bot takes the respective commands to run puppeteer that scrapes the NUS website to take the temperature for the user
2. UserID and Password are encrypted on mongodb cloud server
