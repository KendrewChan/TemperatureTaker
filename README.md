# TemperatureTaker
- Due to Covid-19, NUS students are required to take their temperature on an online website
-> We decided to make things easier by allowing them to run a single command on telegram to take this temperature!
-> Telegram bot takes the respective commands to run puppeteer that scrapes the NUS website to take the temperature for the user
-> UserID and Password are encrypted on mongodb cloud server
